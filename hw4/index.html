<h1>Homework 4</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p>Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs. Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</p>

<p>Here is the scene where we can clearly see the structure of the point masses and springs:</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p>Experiment with some of the parameters in the simulation. Describe the effects of changing the spring constant \(k_s\), density, and damping. Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state.</p>

<h2>Part 3</h2>

<p>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default \(k_s = 5000\) as well as with \(k_s = 500\) and \(k_s = 50000\). Describe the differences in the results. Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane.</p>

<h2>Part 4</h2>

<p>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state. Vary the density as well as \(k_s\) and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.</p>
